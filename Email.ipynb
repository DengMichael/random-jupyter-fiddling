AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for ', 'community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be ', 'amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, ', \"currently in AB 8X.

', ' ', 'According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, ', 'Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money ', 'available in the General Fund.

Again, the Republicans are not in support of these ', 'authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the ', 'governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond ', 'amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to ', 'support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB ', '6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  ', 'for purchasing power.

The ', 'first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the ', 'governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is ', 'August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According ', 'to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has ', 'signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis ', 'and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates ', 'that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary ', 'bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  ', 'The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond ', 'issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) ', 'stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, ', 'then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the ', 'state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and ', 'passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for ', 'bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and ', 'the DWR proportionately from rate payments.']\n",

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. ', 'March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand ', 'over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for ', 'temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates ', 'into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as ', 'compared with the previous year.', 'Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary ', 'reductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other ', 'forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making ', 'total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  ', 'This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple ', 'more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% ', 'decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the ', 'retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it ', 'is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last ', 'year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in ', 'Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation ', 'are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of ', 'meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general ', 'economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least ', 'make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.', 'Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area ', 'only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC ', '(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO ', 'portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in ', 'demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As ', 'you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum ', 'smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at ', 'least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its ', 'wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several ', 'mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are ', 'sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly ', 'how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  ', \"Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's \", 'economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of ', 'the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I ', 'think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already ', 'realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the ', 'non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the ', 'WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around ', '6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.', 'I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you ', 'with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I ', 'hope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any ', 'questions or need any further information.']\n",

', 'The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the ', 'forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a ', 'supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. ', '\"Traders do that all the time; they\\'re looking forward,\" said William Burson, ', 'a trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\" ', \"But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas \", \"Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the \", 'storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the ', 'numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than ', 'reality. ', '\"It\\'s a little frustrating that they don\\'t take the time to understand what ', 'we are reporting,\" McGill said. ', 'As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- ', 'and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing ', 'fingers at Wall Street. ', 'Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently ', \"stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for \", 'the rise in gas prices. ', '\"It\\'s my firm belief ... that today\\'s gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adik ', 'told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. ', 'In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric ', 'utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. ', 'Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame ', \"for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their \", 'customers and constituents from such price spikes. ', 'Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take ', 'precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price ', 'insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas ', 'prices before they soared. ', '\"We\\'re passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said Paul ', 'Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. ', 'But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. ', '\"There\\'s been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to ', 'change,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security ', 'Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. ', 'Hot topic ', 'Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In ', 'many circles, little else is discussed. ', 'The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is ', 'facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the ', \"previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as \", 'well. ', 'The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of ', 'his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial ', 'pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. ', '\"It\\'s the talk of the town here,\" he said. ', \"A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per \", \"thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile \", 'to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by ', 'customers. ', 'But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand ', 'cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage ', 'for winter. ', 'There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, ', 'prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information ', 'Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating ', 'bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. ', 'But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, ', 'including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas ', 'markets. ', '\"It\\'s all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. ', 'Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York ', 'traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile ', 'commodity in the world. ', 'Setting the price ', 'In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of ', 'gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading ', 'contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had ', 'widespread influence over gas prices. ', 'The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon ', 'as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale ', 'prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from ', 'utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what ', 'they pay for the gas they expect to use. ', 'There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention ', 'of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge ', 'of natural gas. ', \"But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to \", \"know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all \", 'futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to ', \"their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money \", 'in a short time. ', 'As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less ', 'than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. ', \"Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's \", 'weekly storage numbers. ', 'Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to ', 'need in the winter. ', 'Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than ', 'average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in ', \"hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. \", 'Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be ', 'sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the ', 'concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. ', 'Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage ', 'numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the ', \"association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. \", \"But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice \", \"president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had \", 'continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. ', '\"I was getting worried,\" he said. ', \"Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. \", \"Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices \", 'dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. ', 'Just passing through ', 'Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but ', 'pass their fuel costs on to customers. ', \"Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas \", 'charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas ', 'Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. ', 'Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last ', 'month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could ', 'be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve ', 'energy. ', 'Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to ', 'save an average customer about $25 this winter. ', 'Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an ', 'extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not ', 'guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. ', 'Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left ', 'customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether ', 'they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel ', 'costs. ', 'On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public ', 'Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to ', \"perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. \", '\"Consumers are taking all the risk,\" Micheel said. \"It\\'s time to consider ', 'some changes.\" ', 'To reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to ', 'severly@kcstar.com.

He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the ', 'benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he ', 'would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power ', '(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented ', 'solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix ', \"the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.\", 'Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also ', 'included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed ', 'interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a ', 'goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities ', 'to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate ', 'analysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues ', 'including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  ', 'He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas ', 'purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding ', 'some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.', 'His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously ', 'under serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".  ', 'Some of these ideas would require legislative action.', 'State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of ', 'generation plants.

Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should \", 'get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be ', 'likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). ', ' ', 'According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, ', 'Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money ', 'available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated ', 'that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  ', 'Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The ', 'Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, ', 'Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and ', 'there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.', ' ', 'Key Points of the Bridge Financing', 'Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B', 'Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B', '   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B', '   Bear Stearns  $625 M', 'Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt', 'Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%', '   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%', 'Current Projected ', 'Blended IR:  5.38%', 'Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001', 'For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510', 'Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time', 'The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the ', 'California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion ', 'authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be ', 'authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the ', 'additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing ', 'power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these ', 'authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the ', 'governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond ', 'amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to ', 'support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB ', '6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  ', 'for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  ', 'the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  ', 'be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this ', 'idea  earlier in the crisis.', ' ', 'SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy', 'At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The ', 'first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the ', 'governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is ', 'August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According ', 'to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has ', 'signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis ', 'and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates ', 'that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary ', 'bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  ', 'The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond ', 'issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) ', 'stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, ', 'then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the ', 'state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and ', 'passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for ', 'bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and ', 'the DWR proportionately from rate payments.']\n",

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. ', 'March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand ', 'over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for ', 'temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates ', 'into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as ', 'compared with the previous year.', 'Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary ', 'reductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other ', 'forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making ', 'total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  ', 'This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple ', 'more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% ', 'decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the ', 'retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it ', 'is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last ', 'year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in ', 'Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation ', 'are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of ', 'meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general ', 'economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least ', 'make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.', 'Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area ', 'only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC ', '(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO ', 'portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in ', 'demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As ', 'you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum ', 'smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at ', 'least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its ', 'wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several ', 'mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are ', 'sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly ', 'how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  ', \"Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's \", 'economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of ', 'the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I ', 'think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already ', 'realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the ', 'non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the ', 'WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around ', '6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.', 'I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you ', 'with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I ', 'hope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any ', 'questions or need any further information.']\n",

', 'The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the ', 'forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a ', 'supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. ', '\"Traders do that all the time; they\\'re looking forward,\" said William Burson, ', 'a trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\" ', \"But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas \", \"Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the \", 'storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the ', 'numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than ', 'reality. ', '\"It\\'s a little frustrating that they don\\'t take the time to understand what ', 'we are reporting,\" McGill said. ', 'As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- ', 'and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing ', 'fingers at Wall Street. ', 'Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently ', \"stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for \", 'the rise in gas prices. ', '\"It\\'s my firm belief ... that today\\'s gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adik ', 'told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. ', 'In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric ', 'utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. ', 'Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame ', \"for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their \", 'customers and constituents from such price spikes. ', 'Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take ', 'precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price ', 'insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas ', 'prices before they soared. ', '\"We\\'re passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said Paul ', 'Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. ', 'But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. ', '\"There\\'s been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to ', 'change,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security ', 'Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. ', 'Hot topic ', 'Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In ', 'many circles, little else is discussed. ', 'The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is ', 'facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the ', \"previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as \", 'well. ', 'The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of ', 'his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial ', 'pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. ', '\"It\\'s the talk of the town here,\" he said. ', \"A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per \", \"thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile \", 'to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by ', 'customers. ', 'But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand ', 'cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage ', 'for winter. ', 'There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, ', 'prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information ', 'Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating ', 'bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. ', 'But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, ', 'including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas ', 'markets. ', '\"It\\'s all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. ', 'Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York ', 'traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile ', 'commodity in the world. ', 'Setting the price ', 'In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of ', 'gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading ', 'contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had ', 'widespread influence over gas prices. ', 'The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon ', 'as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale ', 'prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from ', 'utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what ', 'they pay for the gas they expect to use. ', 'There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention ', 'of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge ', 'of natural gas. ', \"But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to \", \"know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all \", 'futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to ', \"their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money \", 'in a short time. ', 'As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less ', 'than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. ', \"Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's \", 'weekly storage numbers. ', 'Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to ', 'need in the winter. ', 'Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than ', 'average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in ', \"hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. \", 'Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be ', 'sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the ', 'concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. ', 'Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage ', 'numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the ', \"association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. \", \"But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice \", \"president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had \", 'continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. ', '\"I was getting worried,\" he said. ', \"Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. \", \"Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices \", 'dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. ', 'Just passing through ', 'Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but ', 'pass their fuel costs on to customers. ', \"Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas \", 'charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas ', 'Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. ', 'Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last ', 'month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could ', 'be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve ', 'energy. ', 'Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to ', 'save an average customer about $25 this winter. ', 'Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an ', 'extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not ', 'guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs.

The gov does not want the utilities to ', 'go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what ', 'the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more ', 'work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He ', 'talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail ', 'level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the ', 'benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he ', 'would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power ', '(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented ', 'solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix ', \"the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.\", 'Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also ', 'included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed ', 'interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a ', 'goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities ', 'to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate ', 'analysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues ', 'including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  ', 'He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas ', 'purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding ', 'some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.', 'His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously ', 'under serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".  ', 'Some of these ideas would require legislative action.', 'State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of ', 'generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that ', 'they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This ', 'was a frequently recurring theme.', 'Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus ', 'basis to consumers.', 'Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in ', 'California.', 'State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more ', 'widely deploy distributed generation.', 'Expand in-state gas production.', 'Take state lands gas royalties in kind.', 'negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for ', 'addtional gas supplies.', 'Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant ', 'maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at ', 'any one time.', 'Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.', 'Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear ', \"more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be \", 'able to help out here).', 'Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.

Thus, the additional equity for the', 'improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would', 'cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds', 'spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the', 'preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a', 'tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can', 'significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.', 'Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total', 'lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably', '$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The', 'improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design', 'costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and', 'landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for', 'undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would', 'estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the', 'loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give', 'you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required', 'of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing', 'is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the', 'separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility', 'standpoint.', 'CONSTRUCTION LOANS', 'There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative', '(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is', 'a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the', 'builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction', 'loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to', 'start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans', 'in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any', 'construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too', 'difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.', 'Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for', 'pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will', 'be from 80% to 95% of value.', 'DISBURSEMENTS', 'Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and', 'near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority', 'payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner', 'will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the', 'fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to', '15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.', 'These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to', 'calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership', 'expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has', 'to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or', 'cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this', 'function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain', 'from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.', 'Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is', 'used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own', 'any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track', 'to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.', 'REPORTING', 'We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.', 'What did you have in mind?

Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:\", '\\tISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).', '\\tAny unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time).', '\\tInformation related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining).', 'All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes.  Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future.  This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us.  Ray', ' ']\n",

Interesting.\", 'Ken', 'Indigestion ', 'Daniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01 ', 'All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not.', \"For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid. \", \"Ah, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen. \", 'Studness determined that 79% of the \"new\" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there\\'s plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand. ', \"Coal's advantage over gas: It's cheap. Utilities paid an average of $1.20 per million Btu for coal last year, compared with $4.30 for gas (delivered). Even with depressed gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. So while those new turbines being installed by Calpine (nyse: CPN - news - people) and other independent power producers, (see table, below) will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much. \", ' ', 'Addressing a Burning Issue ', 'If natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.

Source: Market Guide via FactSet Research Systems. ', '\"It\\'s not our game to compete with coal or nuclear,\" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. \"It\\'s our game to displace older gas.\" ', 'Combined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day. ', 'That scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy\\'s 35-year-old coal plants are \"huge capital hogs,\" Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says. ', 'But coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules. ', 'Long term, the bullish scenario still holds: Gas will displace coal. In the meantime, gas producers have a lot of bonds to retire. ']\n",

A por=', 'tion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form o=', 'f improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinves=', 'ted back into high-growth areas of the business.   In addition to the activ=', 'ities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress=', ' on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the yea=', 'r and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of $700 million. =', '  Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and one-=', 'time costs related to September 11th, was approximately $595 million, down =', '19 percent.

The company\\'s adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent.   \"While we w=', 'ere on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terro=', 'rist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and =', 'we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and inv=', 'estment activity slowed after September 11th,\" said Kenneth I.

This, along with the anticipated be=', 'nefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franc=', 'hise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in=', ' the economy.\"   Travel Related Services (TRS) reported quarterly net incom=', 'e of $248 million, down 51 percent from $507 million in the third quarter a=', ' year ago. Included in third quarter results are $195 million pre-tax ($127=', ' million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Also include=', 'd in the results are $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-tim=', 'e costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist at=', \"tacks. Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS' net income =\", 'would have been $432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last y=', \"ear.   TRS' net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee reven=\", 'ues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a =', '28 percent fall in travel sales. These declines reflect a substantial decre=', 'ase in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel sinc=', 'e September 11th. Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarte=', 'r was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offs=', 'et a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. Net finance ch=', 'arge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yie=', 'lds. This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introd=', 'uctory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter=', '.   The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of =', 'higher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending write-off rates and delinque=', 'ncies. Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certa=', 'in marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. Operating=', ' expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and busine=', 'ss volumes. These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineer=', 'ing and cost-control efforts.   The above discussion presents TRS results \"=', 'on a managed basis\" as if there had been no securitization transactions, wh=', 'ich conforms to industry practice. The attached financials present TRS resu=', 'lts on both a managed and reported basis. Net income is the same in both fo=', \"rmats.   On a reported basis, TRS' results included securitization gains of=\", ' $29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) and $26 million pre-tax ($17 m=', 'illion after-tax) in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. The=', 'se gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and=', ' therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses.

Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season.    Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.  \\t', \"  Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week.    Answer - GG     Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement.  \\t\", '  Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?    Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.  \\t', \"    Tip of the Week      Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is  a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle.  And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.  \\t\", '  This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

Tip of the Week   \\t', ' [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  \\t', \"    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  \\t\", \"    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  \\t\", \"    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   \\t\", \"  Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  \\t\", \"  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   \\t\", \"  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   \\t\", '    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday.
